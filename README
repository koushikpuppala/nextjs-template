## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure as needed. Below are the available variables:

| Variable                        | Description                                                                            |

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`        | Public Sentry DSN used for error tracking on the client side                           |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOY_URL`        | Public deployment URL without trailing slash (used for metadata, redirects, SEO, etc.) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS`  | Google Analytics Measurement ID for tracking site usage                                |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MICROSOFT_CLARITY` | Microsoft Clarity tracking code for session recording and heatmaps                     |

> See `.env.example` for the full list and format. All variables should be set in your `.env.local` for local development and deployment.

## Middleware

This template includes a `middleware.ts` file for handling advanced routing, authentication, logging, or other server-side logic. You can customize `middleware.ts` in the root directory to add features such as:

- Authentication and access control
- Request logging
- URL rewrites and redirects
- Custom headers

Refer to [Next.js Middleware documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) for more details.

## Deployment

Supports Vercel, Docker, and other platforms.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I add a new page?** A: Add a new file in the `app/` directory. Next.js will automatically route it.

**Q: How do I use Prisma with a different database?** A: Update `PRISMA_URI` or `MONGO_URI` in your `.env.local` and run `pnpm generate`.

**Q: How do I enable/disable analytics or session tracking?** A: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS` and/or `NEXT_PUBLIC_MICROSOFT_CLARITY` in your environment variables.

**Q: How do I configure Sentry?** A: Set `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` as needed.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter build errors, ensure all environment variables are set.
- For Prisma issues, check your database connection and run `pnpm generate`.
- For Tailwind CSS issues, ensure your config files are present and valid.
